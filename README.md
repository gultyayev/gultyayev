### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer who's using Angular as main framework.

ðŸ’¬ Write [articles about Angular on Medium](https://medium.com/@sergeygultyayev).

âš¡ Created [a package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scaffold-angular) aimed to create Angular apps with ESLint, Stylelint, Husky set up.

âš¡ Created [a website](https://gultyayev.github.io/learning-front-end/) with projects and tips for beginner front-end developers to learn by practice.
Each project provides a well-described API which can be used as a backend to build front-end on top of it.
